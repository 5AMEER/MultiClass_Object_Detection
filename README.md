# Object Detection using YOLO Ultralytics Model

This repository contains a comprehensive object detection project implemented using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model from Ultralytics. The project is designed to detect objects in various inputs, including images, videos, and real-time webcam feed, and classify them into 80+ different classes.

## Features

- Object detection using YOLO ultralytics pretrained model version 8.
- Support for image, video, and live camera inputs for real-time detection.
- Automatic classification into over 80 object classes, including common objects, animals, and more.

## Model Details

The YOLO ultralytics pretrained model is a state-of-the-art object detection architecture that provides remarkable accuracy and speed. The model has been fine-tuned to detect a wide range of objects, making it suitable for various applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and more.

## Concepts Covered

- YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection methodology.
- Transfer learning to fine-tune pretrained models.
- Real-time object detection and classification.
- Handling different types of inputs (images, videos, live webcam feed).
- PyCharm Professional by JetBrains as the integrated development environment (IDE).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `object_detection.py` script to start detecting objects in your desired input.
